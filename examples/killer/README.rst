Killer example
==============

This example demonstrates two "killer" features

1. How to kill particles, by modifying the alive attribute
   of the state.

2. How to have a local ibm-module in the working directory
   that can easily be modified without re-installing ladim

Particles are released continuously from a fixed point and are
killed when they reach the age of two days.
